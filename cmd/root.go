	Short: "A CLI-based Zettelkasten note-taking system",
	Long: `zk is a command-line tool for managing notes, tasks, and projects 
based on the Zettelkasten method. It provides an efficient way to create, 
organize, and search notes, helping you build a structured knowledge system.

  - Organize tasks within notes (task new, task list, task status)

Examples:
  # Create a new note
  zk new "My First Note"

  # List all notes
  zk list

  # Search for a note
  zk search "Golang"

  # Add a task to a note
  zk task add 123 "Learn Kubernetes"

  # Change task status
  zk task status 123 Done
